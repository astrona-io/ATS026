# Prerequisites

Use a host shell with astrona, kubectl and Python 3. 

Use a host shell with this lab's private kubeconfig. A kubeconfig identifies the cluster and credentials used by kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool. This environment is separate from the ungraded playground.

```sh
export KUBECONFIG="$(astrona kubeconfig ats-026-lab-050-01-02)"
test "$(kubectl config current-context)" = "kind-astro-ats-026-lab-050-01-02" || exit 1
```

Keep this connection selected throughout the task. Every script supplied by the lab refuses a different context.
